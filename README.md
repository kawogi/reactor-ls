# Reactor-Ls
Reactor-Ls racing game and engine

## Preface and Motivation
I'm a big fan of zero-g racers such as Sony's Wipe'Out. Since Wipe'Out is only supported on the playstation I switched to Redout by 34BigThings and I was totally excited about the overall sound design, physics and sense of speed. Sadly they never implemented a lot of features requested by their user base and - this is my main problem - it officially only runs under Windows while I migrated to Linux some years ago.

Even though the availability of Linux(-compatible) games is continuously increasing, I didn't find anything comparable to those aforementioned racing games. Being a developer with some random experience in computer games, I'm having this irrepressible itch to fix that. I've been collecting ideas over the recent years, sketched some game engines, even started to code parts of a game every now and then. By gaining more experience over time I had to admit that this is orders of magnitude big for a single person. And, without someone paying my bills, I won't be able to invest enough time.

So, am I asking for others to code my favorite game? Yes and no. I'm sure that what I have in mind is something for a bigger audience and has room for improvements - so it would be _our_ favorite game. Seeing that others are interested in the outcome will certainly boost my motivation to invest a bigger part of my spare time.

What about revenues? This won't make anyone rich and famous - but I wouldn't be exactly offended if that happens. First priority is that this game comes to life at all - at whatever state. The engine shall be open source and free in its heart but at the moment I think it's okay to allow commercial products based thereon (maybe mods, spin-offs, community servers).

## The Engine

(yes I'll start with the technical stuff)

While the primary goal of this project is to have a playable racing game, I think it's wise to separate the game engine from the actual game. Either right from the start or at an early stage. This way other games can be built based on that engine without having to incoporate too many styles and wishes into a single application.
